# Purpose

Experimentation and reckless feeding. PRs gladly welcomed. Not sure how many people would be interested in this so I guess we'll find out. 

# Current Status

Working on a base image first before trying the desktop parts. The more people dive in the faster we can get there. ðŸ˜„

## Current Ideas

- hyperscale sig provides newer kernels, we don't need to stay old old.
- GNOME47 will be shipping, we have builds for our stuff already
- EPEL will fill in lots of stuff
