I'm currently dailying `yellowfin` and plan on using `albacore-server` as a replacemnt to my Proxmox server. Let me know if you are using/liking any of these images. I'm currently assuming I'm the only one using the right now. Open an issue or come hangout at the [AlmaLinux Atomic SIG Chat](https://chat.almalinux.org/almalinux/channels/sigatomic) or the [Universal Blue Discord](https://discord.gg/WEu6BdFEtp)
